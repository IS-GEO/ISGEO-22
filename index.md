## Overview
**Registration is now Open!** [Registration Link](https://forms.gle/96BmnWmLcfpM8WJHA)

IS-GEO and iHARP are pleased to announce a virtual workshop on Model-based Reasoning. Invited expert, Dr. Deana Pennington from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) brings prior expertise in evaluating social learning and model-based reasoning together with clear guidance for successful transdisciplinary team building. 

Model-based reasoning uses mental models, simulation models, and everything in between to understand how researchers can collaboratively integrate their subject matter expertise of problems and generate combined knowledge from their different perspectives.

This workshop will provide methods that engage researchers across disciplines to explore how data and models can inform AI. Hands-on activities will support the development of conceptual models and participatory modeling implementation using data across applications in polar regions, hydrologic models, hazards planning, and climate change impacts on communities, as well as other topics salient to workshop participants. 

A mini-hackthon will be hosted during the latter half of the workshop allowing geosciences, cognitive sciences, data science, and advanced intelligent systems to form mixed teams and then pitch, develop, and present results from adhoc project ideas created during this event.


## Workshop Sessions and Topics will include: 
* Learn how to bridge across disciplines for convergent research 
* Data science skills for spatiotemporal data modeling,
* Best practices for cyberinfrastructure design
* High resolution image processing and analysis, 
* Ontological descriptions of common tools used in earth sciences and data science
* Sharing pedagogical resources that can be used in your classroom
* Earth systems modeling of antarctica ice sheets, 
* Lightning talks from fellow participants
