<p><strong>Registration is now Open!</strong> <a href="https://forms.gle/96BmnWmLcfpM8WJHA">Registration Link</a></p>

<p>IS-GEO and iHARP are pleased to announce a virtual workshop on Model-based Reasoning. Invited expert, Dr. Deana Pennington from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) brings prior expertise in evaluating social learning and model-based reasoning together with clear guidance for successful transdisciplinary team building.</p>

<p>Model-based reasoning uses mental models, simulation models, and everything in between to understand how researchers can collaboratively integrate their subject matter expertise of problems and generate combined knowledge from their different perspectives.</p>

<p>This workshop will provide methods that engage researchers across disciplines to explore how data and models can inform AI. Hands-on activities will support the development of conceptual models and participatory modeling implementation using data across applications in polar regions, hydrologic models, hazards planning, and climate change impacts on communities, as well as other topics salient to workshop participants.</p>

<p>A mini-hackthon will be hosted during the latter half of the workshop allowing geosciences, cognitive sciences, data science, and advanced intelligent systems to form mixed teams and then pitch, develop, and present results from adhoc project ideas created during this event.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-sessions-and-topics-will-include">Workshop Sessions and Topics will include:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learn how to bridge across disciplines for convergent research</li>
  <li>Data science skills for spatiotemporal data modeling,</li>

              <p>My group focuses on the physics of glacier ice and the role of the ice  sheets in the climate system. Ice sheets play a central role in the  climate system: they store significant amounts of fresh water and are  the conveyor belts for transporting snow that accumulates inland back  into the oceans. The interactions of the ice sheets with the atmosphere  and the ocean have an internal variability but also affect the coupled ice  sheet–climate response to external forcings on time scales of months to  millions of years. If the current warming of the climate continues, the ice  sheets will respond at a yet unknown rate, with unknown consequences for the  rest of the climate system. A better understanding of the processes driving  these changes is critical to improve projections of sea level rise.
