      The OntoSoft project is part of the NSF EarthCube Initiative. The NSF EarthCube  Initiative aims to enable scientists to solve challenging problems that span  diverse geoscience domains. This requires not only data sharing, it requires  new forms of knowledge sharing. The focus of OntoSoft is to promote knowledge  sharing about the software developed for geosciences.
