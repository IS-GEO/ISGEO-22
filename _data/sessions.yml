    My group focuses on the physics of glacier ice and the role of the ice 
    sheets in the climate system. Ice sheets play a central role in the 
    climate system: they store significant amounts of fresh water and are 
    the conveyor belts for transporting snow that accumulates inland back 
    into the oceans. The interactions of the ice sheets with the atmosphere 
    and the ocean have an internal variability but also affect the coupled ice 
    sheet–climate response to external forcings on time scales of months to 
    millions of years. If the current warming of the climate continues, the ice 
    sheets will respond at a yet unknown rate, with unknown consequences for the 
    rest of the climate system. A better understanding of the processes driving 
    these changes is critical to improve projections of sea level rise.
